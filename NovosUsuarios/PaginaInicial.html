    <h1>Nossa Empresa</h1>
    <p>One morning, my mother woke me up and told me that my Aunt Zeny and her children were downstairs. They came to invite us for a swim at the beach. The beach is just an hour away from our place, so my mom decided to go with them. My mom helped me prepare my bag. We did not cook any food since we would buy snacks on the way. I could see my cousinsâ€™ excitement as we headed towards the beach. </p>
